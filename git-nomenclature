//**nomenclature
workdir     //working directory or working tree
repo        //Repository  
Local Repository  //local computer
Remote Repository //server computer

Repository contains:
index       //cache, or staging area
HEAD        //points to most recent commit
master      //default branch for repo
branch      //a distinct version of src files
origin      //default link name for remote repo
tracked     //files previously committed


HEAD & <branch> are pointers.
<branch> points the last commit
HEAD points to current commit in each branch.

checkout <branch> sets HEAD=<branch>
checkout <branch> moves HEAD & branch to the last commit
checkout #hash moves HEAD to a specific commit
index compares Wdir w/ HEAD
index track changes between Wdir & HEAD commit

reset moves branch ptr & HEAD 
git reset --clears the index but not Wdir
