//**Nomenclature
Repository: (Repo) Directory where your projects are stored. 
Can be a local folder on your computer, or online storage space on GitHub or other host. 
You can store code files, text files, image files, etc inside a repository.

Version Control: The purpose of Git.
Without version control, you edit a text file, and either 
1) overwrite the saved file or
2) with "save as", or you save multiple versions. 
Git keeps snapshots of every point in time in the projects history, so you can never lose or overwrite it.

Commit: A Git command to take a snapshot of your repository at that point in time, 
giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state.

Branch: Version Control that Allows multiple people work on a project at the same time.
Deveopers branch off of the main project with their own versions full of changes. 
After theyre done, they merge that branch back with the master,the main directory of the project.
